	<h2>Course Description</h2>

		<p>
			This course explores interactive design. Emphasis will be placed on
			technical fundamentals of both User Experience (UX) and User Interface
			(UI) as well as concept development and the application of Graphic Design
			fundamentals. The primary medium for the course will be web design but the
			topics discussed translate to other interactive media, such as mobile
			apps, screen-based kiosks, and more.
		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout each unit there will be readings, online tutorials,
			demos, and exercises that will provide overviews of the neces-
			sary skills/knowledge needed to succeed in this class. Critiques
			will serve as an opportunity for you and your peers to present
			your work and receive feedback for further fine tuning.
		</p>
		<p>
			The course will be a mix of instruction, usually via discussion or
			technical demonstrations and studio time, which is free time for you to
			work on your projects and receive closer attention from the instructor.
			Important class updates will be communicated via email to your UWP
			address, so please be sure to check your email regularly.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this studio we will concentrate on learning fundamental web design
			technologies: HyperText Markup Lanugage (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets
			(CSS), and more. There are a huge number of platforms and services
			available to you on the web today: OtherPeoplesPixels,  WordPress, Wix,
			Squarespace... the list is very long. HTML and CSS are foundational, so no
			matter what additional web technologies you choose or what platforms come
			and go, they will always be in the equation. We will work with those tools
			to allow you maximum flexibility for the future.
		</p>

		<ul>
			Upon completion of this course the student should be able to:
			<li>Understand web-oriented user interface and user experience design concepts</li>
			<li>Develop conceptual problem solving skills related to user interface and
			user experience design on the web</li>
			<li>Acquire field-related technical proficiency</li>
			<li>Build vocabulary for user interface and user experience design</li>
			<li>Enhance critical thinking and analytical skills</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			The objectives will be achieved by:
			<li>Completing projects of increasing complexity</li>
			<li>In class & homework exercises</li>
			<li>Analysis & critique one’s own work & then applying that skill to the work
			of others</li>
			<li>Readings, lectures, demonstrations & discussion of readings</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Course Delivery</h2>

		<p>
			Our primary meeting method will be in-person. I will make any lecture
			slides  available online through Canvas following our class meetings. In
			the event that we need to move online, we will meet via Zoom in a
			synchronous fashion, meaning we will meet at the same time as our typical
			in-person meetings. Invitations to any online meetings in Zoom will be
			sent via email.
		</p>

	<h2>Course Prerequisites</h2>

		<p>
		ART 105 and one of: ART 372; CSCI 130, 145, 241 or MIS 221.
		</p>

	<h2>Workload</h2>

		<p>
			Students are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings and complete
			assignments on time. Students will need to spend time beyond scheduled
			work days to complete assignments and projects.
		</p>

	<h2>Student Hours (formerly known as Office Hours)</h2>

		<p>
			If you are having difficulty with a project, or have questions about your
			work, design, or anything else, please send me an email and come to
			student hours. We can meet in my office, the library, student center, or
			basically any other location on campus. If my scheduled time does not work
			for you, please send me an email and we will work something out, including
			meeting via Zoom. I am always happy to talk one-on-one as needed.
		</p>

	<h2>Diversity Statement</h2>

		<p>
			I am committed to the principle of universal learning. This means that our
			classroom, virtual spaces, practices, and interactions be as inclusive as
			possible. Mutual respect, civility, and

		the ability to listen and observe
		others carefully are crucial to universal learning.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is my intention that students from all diverse backgrounds and
		perspectives be well-served by this course and that the diversity that the
		students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
		benefit. Please contact me if you need accommodation for a religious event
		or if you have suggestions for ways I can help improve your learning
		experience in this course.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this studio, people of all ethnic backgrounds, genders, gender
		identities, religions, ages, sexual orientations, abilities, and
		socioeconomic backgrounds are strongly encouraged to share their rich
		array of perspectives and experiences. This includes correct pronoun
		usage—I have shared my pronouns in this syllabus and I encourage you to do
		the same.
	</p>

<h2>Final Exam</h2>

	<p>
		There is no final exam for this course, though we will have a final exit
		interview/critique, typically during finals week at the scheduled exam
		time.
	</p>

<h2>Extra Credit & Revisions</h2>

	<p>
		No extra credit will be offered, but you may choose to revise and resubmit
		any project before the end of the semester to improve your score.
	</p>

<h2>Grading Scales</h2>

	<p>
		All projects will follow the grading system below. You receive a number
		from 0-4 for a series of project requirements: idea generation, degree of
		progress, depth of thinking, and following directions and craftsmanship.
		Your final grade is an average of those requirements for each project.
	</p>

	<p>
		4=A<br>
		3=B<br>
		2=C<br>
		1=D<br>
		0=F
	</p>


	<p>
		Idea Generation: This is the first step in the design process. I am
		grading you on how you participate in the idea generating activities, if
		you came up with the requested amount of ideas, how well they answered the
		problem of the project, and how they developed into the final product.
	</p>
	<p>
		Depth of Thinking: I am looking at how well you thought about the problem
		and the solutions you were suggesting. Did you do research? Did you look
		at other designs that inspired you? How is that reflected in your design
		solutions? Did you take the information you learned in critique and use
		that to develop your idea even further?
	</p>
	<p>
		Visually Compelling: This is the quality of the final design. Does your
		solution to the design problem meet a level of professional standards in
		the field of graphic design? Did you spend the time developing your idea
		to the best of your ability? Does your composition utilize the fundamental
		principles of design?
	</p>
	<p>
		Following Directions & Craftsmanship: I am making sure that you followed
		all the specifications in the project brief. Is your project the correct
		size? Free from typos? Did you meet all the deadlines and is the final
		project completed on time?

	</p>
	<p>
		Critique Participation: Here I am making sure that you participated in
		critiques. Critique is an essential part of design work, both for your own
		work and helping your colleagues improve their work. Did you comment on
		your colleagues’ work in a respectful, constructive way? Did you recieve
		feedback in a respectful, constructive way? Were you able to clearly
		articulate your ideas and rationalize your design choices when speaking
		about your work?
	</p>

<h2>About Critique</h2>

	<p>
		Critique is a time during class where we give useful input
		to improve the work of our peers. Whether any of us “like”
		the work from our classmates is irrelevant, so try to tailor
		your comments and suggestions to be as objective as pos-
		sible. Key questions might include:
	</p>

	<p>
		“What is the work doing?”<br>
		“How is the work doing what it is doing?”<br>
		“What do we think the designer’s intention
		might have been?”<br>
		“What associations or references does the
		work call to mind?”
	</p>

	<p>
		Each student is highly encouraged to practice being as
		specific as possible and avoid vague and subjective state-
		ments such as: “I like...” “I don’t like...” “...is good” “could
		be better”, etc.
	</p>

<h2>Final Grades</h2>

	<p>
		Your final grade will be based on the accumulative project grades. Project
		grades are based on final product, craftsmanship, and participation in
		critiques. We typically finish between 3-4 projects in a semester.
		Projects are graded and averaged together for the final grade.
	</p>

	<p>
		Class attendance is a must.
	</p>

</div>
<hr>
<div class="page-three">

	<p>
		Late assignments turned in one class period beyond the deadline will be
		graded down one full letter grade.
	</p>

	<p>
		If there is an emergency and you are not able to attend class or turn in
		an assignment on time, please contact me and provide documentation.
	</p>

	<p>
		I think of our new classroom as a working design studio. I expect
		professionalism, timeliness, good communication, and above all, respect
		for each other. This is necessary for successful critiques and projects.
	</p>

<h2>Class Attendance</h2>

	<p>
		Attendance will be taken at each class meeting. You are allowed 3
		unexcused absences for the semester before your final grade will be
		impacted. Obviously, these are unpredictable times and if we communicate,
		I am sure any issues with attendance can be figured out.
	</p>

<h2>Students with Disabilities</h2>

	<p>
		I am committed to the principle of universal learning. This means that our
		classroom, virtual spaces, practices, and interactions be as inclusive as
		possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe
		others carefully are crucial to universal learning.
	</p>

	<p>
		Any student with a documented disability who needs academic adjustments or
		accommodations is requested to speak with me during the first two weeks of
		class. All discussions will remain confidential. Students with
		disabilities should also contact Disability Services in WYLL D175 at 595-
		2372 or 595-2610.

	</p>

<h2>Publicity</h2>

	<p>
		The Art Department reserves the right to use reproductions of student work
		for promotional purposes, including the university website.
	</p>

<h2>Concealed Carry</h2>

	<p>
		Weapons are prohibited in UW-Parkside buildings and all outdoor events.
		Anyone found in violation will be subject to immediate removal in addition
		to academic and/or legal sanctions.
	</p>

<h2>Unexpected Class Cancelation</h2>

	<p>
		If a class session needs to be cancelled unexpectedly due to instructor
		illness or emergency, the instructor will notify students via UWP email.
		While university staff will try to post cancellation signs in the studio
		or classroom in a timely manner, email will be the main platform for
		notification.
	</p>


<h2>Etiquette</h2>

	<p>
		I expect every participant in this class to treat your colleagues with
		respect. This includes use of welcoming, inclusive, encouraging language.
		Avoid abbreviations, acronyms, irony, and sarcasm as they are not easily
		understood by all students and may be misinterpreted.
	</p>

<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>

	<p>
		Plagiarism is a serious offense in the design and academic community! All
		ideas, concepts, images, photos, illustration and text must be completely
		original or properly sourced and cited. If you have been found
		plagiarizing you will immediately be asked to leave the course and receive
		an F. Remember, just because you find an item on the Internet does not
		mean it is available for you to use. Please refer to UWP Misconduct Policy
		#28 for definitions of academic misconduct and possible sanctions.
	</p>

<h2>Ranger Community Health and Safety Standards</h2>

	<p>
		UW-Parkside has implemented reasonable health and safety protocols based
		on recommendations by public health authorities in response to the COVID-
		19 pandemic. These protocols may change based on prevailing health
		conditions. As a member of our campus community, you are expected to abide
		by the health and safety rules developed in accordance with public health
		guidelines. These standards apply to anyone who is physically present on
		campus, UW-Parkside grounds, or participating in a UW-Parkside-sponsored
		activity:
	</p>

	<p>
		Social distancing of 3-feet is recommended.
	</p>
		Residential students who have not uploaded their vaccination verification
		to MyChart are required to test weekly in the Ranger Hall Clinic.
	<p>
		Commuter students who come to campus at least once a week and have not
		uploaded their vaccination verification to MyChart are required to test
		bi-weekly in the Ranger Hall Clinic.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you have already been vaccinated please upload your record of
		vaccination to MyChart as soon as possible.
	</p>

	<ul>
		If you have not been vaccinated, here are several options:
		<li>Call the Student Health & Counseling Center at (262) 595-
		2366 to schedule an appointment.</li>
		<li>Visit www.vaccines.gov (Links to an external site.) to locate

</div>

<div class="page-four">

		a vaccine clinic near you.</li>
		<li>Do not come to class if you are feeling ill or experiencing
		COVID-19 symptoms. It is your responsibility to notify your
		instructor of any absences including any required periods
		of quarantine/isolation.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Based on our experience, COVID-19 infections were spread in
		higher-risk social activities such as parties, group gatherings
		without masks and appropriate social distancing, and travel
		rather than in the classroom. The best way to ensure an in-per-
		son experience with face-to-face classes and campus activities
		is to get vaccinated, wear your mask, and maintain appropriate
		social distancing.
	</p>
